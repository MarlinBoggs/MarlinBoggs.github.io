# MarlinBoggs.github.io
Personal Website project created to: aid me in my job search, improve web development and design skills, and serve as landing page for personal projects.

The website was built using: 
- CSS/HTML to serve as the core
- JavaScript for Slideshow Carousel Photography Blog (www.marlinboggs.com/photo.html)
- BootStrap for additional CSS styling
- FontAwesome for social media icons
- Google Font API for additional fonts (Libre Baskerville and Heebo) 

Feel free to leverage format, styling, or design to build your own personal website. Working on this personal project helped me market myself better to prospective employers (ultimately landing me a job at Spreedly) and draw inspiration for personal projects. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
