                <p>Fuqua has pushed me to grow immensely over two years. In leading the Design & Innovation Club, I've strengthened my creative muscles and have discovered a new-found obsession with design.
                I've expanded my comfort zone by participating in a theater improv group, performing music in front of hundreds of classmates, and living abroad in Barcelona - fully immersing myself in the language and culture.</p>
                <p>Fuqua has enabled me to pursue my love of learning alongside inspiring peers. I've summarized my experiences at business school in my recent <u>15 Minute MBA</u> (coming soon!) post.</p>
