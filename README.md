Personal Website project created to: aid me in job search, improve web development and design skills, and serve as landing page for personal projects.

The website was built using: 
- CSS/HTML to serve as the core
- JavaScript for Slideshow Carousel Photography Blog (www.marlinboggs.com/photo.html)
- BootStrap for additional CSS styling
- FontAwesome for social media icons
- Google Font API for additional fonts (Libre Baskerville and Heebo) 

Feel free to leverage styling, code, or design to build your own personal website. Developing this website helped me market myself better to prospective employers (ultimately landing me a PM job at Spreedly) and draw inspiration for new personal projects. 

I wanted to create a website from scratch so that I could save on annual hosting costs (Github Pages is free for static websites) and create a low-maintenance website that felt more minimalist than templates could offer. Feel free to shoot me a message if you have any questions or would like to connect!
